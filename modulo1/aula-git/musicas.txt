HOT - AVRIL LAVIGNE

You're so good to me, baby, baby

I wanna lock you up in my closet when no one's around
I wanna put your hand in my pocket because you're allowed
I wanna drive you into the corner and kiss you without a sound
I wanna stay this way forever, I'll say it loud

Now you're in and can't get out

You make me so hot
Make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe
You make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous
You're so good to me, baby, baby
You're so good to me, baby, baby

I can make you feel all better, just take it in
And I can show you all the places you've never been
And I can make you say everything that you never said
And I will let you do anything again and again

Now you're in and can't get out

You make me so hot
Make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe
You make me wanna scream
You're fabulous
You're so good to me, baby, baby
You're so good to me, baby, baby

Kiss me gently
Always I know
Hold me, love me
Don't ever go, yeah

You make me so hot
Make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe
You make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous
You're so good to me (you're so good to me)

You make me so hot (yeah)
Make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe (breathe)
You make me wanna scream (scream)
You're so fabulous
You're so good to me, baby, baby
You're so good to me, baby, baby

You're so good
